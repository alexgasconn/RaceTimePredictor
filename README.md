Riegel Race Predictor
Riegel Race Predictor is a web-based application that estimates your potential race times across various distances using your personal best performances and the Riegel formula. This tool helps runners set realistic goals and track their progress based on their top race times.​

Features
User-Friendly Interface: Input your top race times directly into the application without the need for file uploads.​

Flexible Data Entry: Enter up to three best times for each distance; if fewer are available, the application adjusts accordingly.​

Weighted Predictions: Utilizes a weighted average approach to provide more accurate race time predictions.​

Real-Time Calculations: Instantly computes predicted race times based on the provided data.​

How It Works
The application employs the Riegel formula to predict race times:​

T₂ = T₁ × (D₂ / D₁)¹·⁰⁶
Where:

T₁ is the time achieved for distance D₁.​

By inputting your best times for known distances, the application calculates predicted times for other distances, helping you set informed training and racing goals.​

Getting Started
Access the Application:

Visit the Riegel Race Predictor hosted on GitHub Pages.​

Input Your Race Times:

For each distance category (Mile, 5K, 10K, Half Marathon), enter your best race times in minutes. You can input up to three times per distance; if you have fewer, leave the additional fields blank.​

Calculate Predictions:

Click the "Predict Times" button to compute your estimated race times for various distances.​

View Results:

The application will display your predicted race times, allowing you to plan your training and racing strategies effectively.​
